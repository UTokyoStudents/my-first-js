# Introduction

## What is programming, anyway?

## Why JavaScript

JavaScript is a very popular programming language, especially for beginners.
Many people with less programming experience have ever seen JavaScript, for example in Web apps.
Javascript has become popular with the spread of client-side Web programming; however it is now common with Node.JS in server-side apps and command line programs.
It is also a common choice as an automation/scripting language.

## How JavaScript is structured

JavaScript is standardised as ECMAScript, a global standard, at ECMA International.
